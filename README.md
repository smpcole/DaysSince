Days Since counter
==================

A simple counter app for iOS which keeps track of the number of days since a specified event, with a 'reset' button that allows you to easily start over from 0 when the event occurs again.

Ultimately, I hope to add support for multiple counters and a Notification Center widget, but for now it is just a single, basic counter.
